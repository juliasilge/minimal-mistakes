My name is Julia Silge and I live in Salt Lake City, UT. I love the mountains, the climate, and my community here. I studied physics and astronomy, finishing my PhD in 2005. During my years in astronomy, I developed near-infrared techniques for measuring how stars in galaxies are moving, modeled supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, and participated in searches for Kuiper belt objects in our own solar system. I have been active in teaching and communicating about STEM with non-expert audiences. I have also worked for an ed tech start-up writing astronomy content for the higher ed classroom. Now, I want to learn the tools used in data science today and apply them to some small projects that are interesting to me. My background in astronomy, physics, and education have given me a strong foundation for using data to answer interesting questions.
